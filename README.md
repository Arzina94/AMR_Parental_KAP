Knowledge attitude and practice(title)
## Abstract
Lipodystrophy is common in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus receiving highly
 active antiretroviral therapy, and presents with morphologic changes and metabolic alterations that are associated
 with depressive behavior and reduced quality of life. We examined the effects of exercise training on
 morphological changes, lipid profile and quality of life in a woman with human immunodeficiency virus presenting
 with lipodystrophy.
